## Usage

TODO: Describe usage or point to docs. Also describe available settings and
templatetags.
### Setup a company
This app supports multiple company with multiple opening and closing hours. 

### Setting up opening hours
This is used to describe when sth. (eg. the shop) is open. This is done on a daily base (per day) by defining one or more 
start and end times of opening slots.

### Setting up closing rules
This is used to describe when sth. (eg. the shop) is closed (eg. due holiday, 
absences, sickness or whatever). Note that the closing hours overrules the opening hours!


## TODO
* Template support for template tags, remove ugly string concating stuff
* Shortcut for everyday (1-7) = 0 in WEEKDAYS, or 8 = monday to friday, etc.
* Global closing hours to overrule all companies. Use cases: close a complete shopping center
