#Django Opening Hours

* to list the opening hours, eg. MON 9h00 to 17h00, etc.

## Usage

### Setup a company
This app supports multiple company with multiple opening and closing hours. 

### Setting up opening hours
This is used to describe when sth. (eg. the shop) is open. This is done on a daily base (per day) by defining one or more 
start and end times of opening slots.

### Optionally, setting up the closing hour rules NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!

This is used to describe/define when sth. (eg. the shop) is closed (eg. due holiday, 
absences, sickness or whatever). Note that the closing hours overrules the opening hours!



In the index.html (https://github.com/arteria/django-openinghours/blob/master/openinghours/templates/openinghours/index.html) you will find a lot of examples how to use this app.

## TODO
* Shortcut for everyday (1-7) = 0 in WEEKDAYS, or 8 = monday to friday, etc.
* Global closing hours to overrule all companies. Use cases: close a complete shopping center
* Implement closing hours, currently you can define them but, .. WIP
